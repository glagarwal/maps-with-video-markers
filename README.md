# maps-with-video-markers
The user can type a search term (a single keyword or phrase such as a personâ€™s first and last names), a street address including a city and an optional zip code, and radius in km. The application will find "keyword" videos in a geographic area centered in longitude, and latitude with given radius. And a map with video markers gets displayed.
